Many of these changes mirror those induced by long-term bed-rest on Earth and with age. This study used the fruit fly *Drosophila* and the worm *Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)* model systems to identify conserved mechanisms underlying the oxidative stress response to altered gravity. This study includes the use of functional, structural, and molecular biological techniques to identify common genetic and molecular components that mediate the effect of microgravity, lunar gravity, and Mars gravity on organ function."

As a part of this study, a microbial consortium derived from a natural perchlorate-reducing system as a pre-inoculant will be tested for its ability to mitigate perchlorate toxins in Martian regolith simulant."

These data and methods will shed light on the complex biosystem dynamics that spaceflight causes in humans, and will enable investigators to clearly dissect the gene expression changes occurring at the single-cell level, analyze how these changes affect the cell-cell genetic and physical interactions, and begin the first-ever in vivo human-microbial interaction maps from spaceflight."

"Upstream Regulation of Nox2 and Skeletal Muscle Atrophy During Microgravity and Countermeasure Development","","Ground Research","Mechanotransduction is the ability to sense and regulate adaptive responses to increased or decreased loading. The investigators working on this project have found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly contribute to both muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift from slow to fast, and through their research, have identified mitochondria, the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase, and upstream angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1R) as sources of ROS during mechanical unloading. The current focus of this work is to gain a better mechanistic understanding how Nox2 is regulated in mammalian systems in the presence of microgravity analogs."
